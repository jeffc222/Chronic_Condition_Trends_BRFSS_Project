-- Step 1: Filter relevant datas
-- Description: Extracts crude prevalence values (2012â€“2022) for 5 selected states across 4 health indicators: Obesity, Diabetes, Smoking, and Depression

WITH filtered_brfss AS (
  SELECT
    Year,
    LocationAbbr,

    Topic,
    Response,

      (Topic = 'Depression' AND Response = 'Yes')

-- Step 2: Pivot indicators into columns per year/state
-- Description: Transforms row-based responses into column format for each indicator (wide format)

  SELECT

    MAX(CASE WHEN Topic = 'Depression' THEN Data_Value END) AS Depression
  FROM filtered_brfss
  GROUP BY Year, LocationAbbr, LocationDesc

-- Step 3: Join to previous year to calculate YoY changes
-- Description: Adds previous year's values for comparison and calculates year-over-year (YoY) percentage changes

    a.LocationAbbr,
    a.LocationDesc,

    b.Smoking AS Smoking_Prev,
    b.Depression AS Depression_Prev,
    -- % change calculation (optional: ROUND to 2 decimal places)
    ROUND((a.Obesity - b.Obesity) / b.Obesity * 100, 2) AS Obesity_YoY,
    ROUND((a.Diabetes - b.Diabetes) / b.Diabetes * 100, 2) AS Diabetes_YoY,
    ROUND((a.Smoking - b.Smoking) / b.Smoking * 100, 2) AS Smoking_YoY,
    ROUND((a.Depression - b.Depression) / b.Depression * 100, 2) AS Depression_YoY
  FROM pivoted a
  LEFT JOIN pivoted b
    ON a.LocationAbbr = b.LocationAbbr AND a.Year = b.Year + 1
)

-- Step 4: Return clean final dataset
-- Description: Outputs the final table ordered by state and year for analysis and visualization  

SELECT *
FROM with_yoy
ORDER BY LocationAbbr, Year;
